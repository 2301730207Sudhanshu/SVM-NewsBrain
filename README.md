# 📰 News Headline Classification using SVM  
### Text Classification with TF-IDF + Support Vector Machine

This project classifies news headlines into categories such as **politics**, **sports**, **automobile**, and **electronics** using **TF-IDF features** and **Linear SVM**.

---

## 📌 Project Objective
Build an intelligent model that reads news text and predicts its correct category using machine learning.

---

## 🧠 Concepts Used
- TF-IDF Feature Extraction  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- Train/Test Split  
- Text Preprocessing  
- Model Evaluation  

---

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- Python  
- Scikit-learn  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  

---

## 🚀 How It Works
1. Load dataset  
2. Clean & preprocess text  
3. Convert text into TF-IDF vectors  
4. Train SVM classifier  
5. Evaluate accuracy  
6. Predict custom news headlines
